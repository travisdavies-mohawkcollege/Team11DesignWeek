# BartenderSimulator
You play as a Bartender in a futuristic - jazz styled theme bar.
You try to make some good relation with the customers by getting to know them and making them the drinks they like.
In relation to making a good rink, the customers will happily tip you something good, whereas if made a bad drink the customers will also simply leave.
In times like these, it is always good to keep your business to yourself and never to mock anyone because you never know what can happen in a split second.
Enjoy the drinks, drifters!
